DSLs in Action in F#
===
### Translation of Code and Examples from Debasish Ghosh's "[DSLs in Action](http://www.manning.com/ghosh/)" ###

---

### Purpose ###
This is an *unfaithful* translation of the book's example to F#. 
Although I tried to make it as close to the original examples as possible, certain examples cannot be expressed in F#, and a few features are not idiomatic to do in F#.
For these reasons, a few examples have been changed to be F#-friendly and a few others are omited (e.g. examples in Chapter 5).

### Setup / Installation ###

### Misc ###

For detailed notes about F#-specific features for DSL development, please refer to [A cheatsheet for F#'s DSL-friendly features](https://github.com/dungpa/dsls-in-action-fsharp/blob/master/DSLCheatsheet.md).

### TODO ###

1. Add listing reference to each example.
2. Revisit old examples to add new functionalities (e.g. after learning F# metaprogramming).
