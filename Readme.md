DSLs in Action in F#
===
### Translation of Code and Examples from Debasish Ghosh's "[DSLs in Action](http://www.manning.com/ghosh/)" ###

---

### Purpose ###
This is an *unfaithful* translation of the book's examples to F#. 
Indeed translating examples from 5 different languages to another language is impossible.
Therefore, I tried to create roughly similar examples in F# and used original code as the source of ideas and inspiration.
Certain examples which cannot be expressed in F# have been omitted or updated to be F#-friendly.

### Setup / Installation ###

### Misc ###

For detailed notes about F#-specific features for DSL development, please refer to [A cheatsheet for F#'s DSL-friendly features](https://github.com/dungpa/dsls-in-action-fsharp/blob/master/DSLCheatsheet.md).

### TODO ###

1. Add listing reference to each example.
2. Revisit old examples to add new functionalities (e.g. after learning F# metaprogramming).
